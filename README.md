- 👋 Hi, I’m: @ham-and (or you can call me Harry)
- 👀 I’m interested: in honestly everything. So much so, I donate to wikipedia. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: how to slow down and spend less time looking at screens. Also, bouldering, german and economics. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: anything socially or community oriented.
